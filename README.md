## Juicer modularised

My slurm script to modularise monolithic [`juicer.sh` file](https://github.com/aidenlab/juicer/blob/master/CPU/juicer.sh)

I believe that running individual steps as a stand along slurm jobs can make it significantly faster (with tweaking certain parameters like RAM and CPU). As well as provides clear mental picture of the data flow
